:rocket: Mad Maxie is a Windows Forms application oriented to provide a more usable friendly user interface for the madMax chia plotter. With advance features. like ram disk and more. Run job on each SSD/ram disk, no need for running program in multiple instance anymore

**Features**

**Multiple final destinations.**

You can add multiple final destinations, Mad Maxie will alternate the final destination for each plotting process using both plot windows.
â€¢	Multiple pools and combined solo and pool plotting
Mad Maxie, you can dual plot, 
1.	Dual plot solo or same pool (NFT)
2.	Solo, and pool plot each one (different address or same)
3.	Plot to two different pools.

Extra improvements/features and user path selections
There are some tweaks and hacks to improve stability and performance of the plotter process, have added user path to select where madMax Stotiks exe file is located, 

1.	Delay timer for second plot to stagger if needed for plot 2

2.	Save 2 profiles per plot, so when switching no need to remember setting can just recall when changing pools etc



**Tools Menu there is Chia, Flax, Goji, Seno Spar**e, 

1.	plot checker
2.	start/stop farmer
3.	start/stop harvester
4.	Show Keys
5.	Show NFT keys
6.	Show Version
7.	Many more
Chia Faucet also in the tools menu and now CMD Window

**What do abbreviations mean**

1.	PCA = Pool Contract Address (for mining on pools)
2.	PK = Pool keys (for solo mining)
3.	FK = Farmer keys

### **Usage:**
  chia_plot [OPTION...]

  -n, --count arg      Number of plots to create (default = 1, -1 = infinite)
  -r, --threads arg    Number of threads (default = 4)
  -u, --buckets arg    Number of buckets (default = 256)
  -v, --buckets3 arg   Number of buckets for phase 3+4 (default = buckets)
  -t, --tmpdir arg     Temporary directory, needs ~220 GiB (default = $PWD)
  -2, --tmpdir2 arg    Temporary directory 2, needs ~110 GiB [RAM] (default = <tmpdir>)
  -d, --finaldir arg   Final directory (default = <tmpdir>)
  -w, --waitforcopy    Wait for copy to start next plot
  -p, --poolkey arg    Pool Public Key (48 bytes)
  -c, --contract arg   Pool Contract Address (62 chars)
  -f, --farmerkey arg  Farmer Public Key (48 bytes)
  -G, --tmptoggle      Alternate tmpdir/tmpdir2 (default = false)
  -h, --help           Print help
  -K, --rmulti2        Thread multiplier for P2 (default = 1)

**Ram Disk Features Added** :rocket:

You will need, 128GB Ram installed to allocate 119GB ram for ram disk, ram disk can only be used for temp 2 directory, this will save your SSDâ€™s or NVMeâ€™s from greater wear and also speed up your plot times you must install the ram disk exe file that come with the zip file as Mad Maxie calls for it in the background.
